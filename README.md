# Dynamic memory
A text file of unknown length is read in the program, it is a program that allocates memory for its size using dynamic memory management logic. When a word is entered by the user, the length of the searched word and its first index are printed if it is present in the text. If this word is not found in the text, the text "The searched word was not found in the text" is printed.
